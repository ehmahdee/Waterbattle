# Waterbattle


## Description

Our motivation for developing Water Battle was to create an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience for users. We aimed to provide a polished user interface, interactive features, and real-time feedback to immerse players in the thrill the Water Battle.

We built this project by using modern technologies such as React, GraphQL, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT authentication, while keeping our goal in mind which is to deliver a high-quality and seamless gaming experience. These technologies enabled us to build a responsive and scalable application that can handle multiple users and maintain data security.

Ultimately, our goal is to create a battleship-type game that users can easily access, play, enjoy and have fun!
