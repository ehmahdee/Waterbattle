# Waterbattle


## Description

Our motivation for developing Water Battle was to create an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience for users. We aimed to provide a polished user interface, interactive features, and real-time feedback to immerse players in the thrill of the Water Battle.

We built this project by using modern technologies such as React, GraphQL, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT authentication, while keeping our goal in mind which is to deliver a high-quality and seamless gaming experience. These technologies enabled us to build a responsive and scalable application that can handle multiple users and maintain data security.

We took on our user story:
"AS A user
I WANT to play a Battleship game with a polished user interface and interactive feature,
SO THAT I can enjoy a seamless gaming experience."

By developing this project, this further solidified our learned knowledge in React for the front end, MongoDB and MongooseODM for the database, queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data, and JWT for authentication to protect sensitive information on the server.  

Some challenges we faced were getting our hits to land against the computer.  At first there was no way the user could win against the computer because the user's hitbox was too big. This was fixed and the user could then become a viable contender against the computer. Additionally, the CPU's ships would overlap and be placed off-grid so again, the user could not win because overlapped ships were not getting hit. Code was updated so that the user's ships could get a hit in against the computer. We were also challenged in getting the multiplayer to work with Socket.io. Thus, multiplayer ability has been moved to an idea for future development.  

Directions for future development include: 
- Implementing multiplayer ability and functionality
- The app having a light & dark mode 
- User ability to save and compare high scores
- Logged total wins & losses
- Social Media Inegration

Ultimately, our goal to create a battleship-type game that users can easily access, play, enjoy, and have fun was achieved.

## Usage

LINK TO DEPLOYED APPLICATION: https://evening-ocean-56179.herokuapp.com/

When the user arrives on the landing page of our application, they will see the homepage of WATERBATTLE.  Here new users can sign up and returning users can login to enter the game.

Once logged in, the user can select the single player or multiplayer option.  In single player mode, the user plays against the computer.  In multiplayer mode, the user can play against another user that is signed in.  Currently, the multiplayer function is not up and running, but is in progress for future development.

Once the player mode is selected, the user can set their ships onto the player grid on the left side.  Ships can be rotated horizontally or vertically by clicking the "Rotate Ships" button.  After the player's ships are placed, click the "Start Game" button.

When the game starts, the player will place hits in the grid on the right.  A red dot signifies a hit to one of the opponent's ships.
